# Descriptive-Statistics-and-Regression-Analysis-with-R
As part of my intermediate analytics course, I did this assignment and we will be using R programming and R studio in order to perform the descriptive and regression data analysis on various datasets. There are so many built in datasets in the R studio and these datasets are really useful to perform test and for practicing data analysis.  With the help of data() function, once can see every list of data sets that are available in R. In return with the help of those data sets we can perform and test data analysis functions and other tools as well. We all know that Descriptive Statistics has different things such as standard deviation, mean, variance, median, skewness of graph, minimum and maximum values, kurtosis, quartiles and many more. Descriptive statistical analysis is used to analyze and present the data in a meaningful manner and is used to study and it is used to give a clarity about already existing data in order to summarize the sample. Whereas, regression analysis is used to predict the value of any dependent variable on the basis of the value of variables that are independent. In this assignment we will be using descriptive statistical analysis and regression analysis in order to perform the given tasks.
